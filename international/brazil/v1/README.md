# Brazil AI Governance Policies

This directory contains OPA Rego policies for AI governance in Brazil, primarily based on **Bill of Law No. 2,338/2023 (PL 2338/23)**.

The policies adopt a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into:

- **Excessive Risk:** Prohibited systems.
- **High-Risk:** Systems subject to stringent compliance requirements.
- **Other Systems:** Systems with basic requirements.

Key principles and rights emphasized in the policies include:
- Right to an explanation of AI decisions.
- Right to contest AI decisions.
- Right to a human review of automated decisions.

Compliance requirements for high-risk systems cover algorithmic impact assessments, robustness, accuracy, reliability, and engagement with oversight authorities.
