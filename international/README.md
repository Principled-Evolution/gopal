## Usage

International policies provide requirements specific to regulatory frameworks from different regions and international standards bodies. These can be applied based on the jurisdiction in which the AI system operates.

## Adding New Policies

When adding new international policies:
1. Place them in the appropriate framework and version directory (e.g., eu_ai_act/v1/)
2. Follow the naming convention: `<policy_area>.rego`
3. Use the package name `international.<framework>.<version>.<policy_area>`
4. Include comprehensive metadata and documentation including references to specific sections of the regulatory text

## Composition

International policies can import global policies to extend them with specific requirements:

```rego
import data.global.v1.fairness
```
